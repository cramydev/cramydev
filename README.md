## Hey guys! My name is Carlos Rodriguez 😁

I'm a fullstack web developer with some UX skills like prototyping and creating lo-fi designer 🤓. 
<br /> <br />

### Development Stack 💻 
My current main development stack are VueJS in frontend, and ExpressJS in backend. About database, I use PostgreSQL with Sequelize ORM. 

I haven't create any project as a UX designer, besides two lo-fi designs, but I've use Figma to practice in creating prototypes ✌. I might use this skills as a hobby, at least for now 😅.
<br /> <br />

### Why I don't have many projects in here? 🤔
Well, the projects I've developed are in GitLab private repositories, so I can't share them 😅.

So, I decided to create this account to share my personal or "random" projects 😁.

This is my website: https://cramydev.netlify.app. I invite you to check some of my projects.😉
